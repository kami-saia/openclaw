## 2026-02-06 | The "MSTR Bear Trap" Reversal

**Trade:** Short MSTR @ ~$129 (and re-entry @ $132).
**Context:** Bitcoin crashed to $60k intraday. "Bearish News" (Stifel $38k prediction) was trending.
**Outcome:** MSTR ripped +25% from lows to close ~$134. BTC V-shaped back to $70k.
**The Mistake:**

1.  **Late Entry:** Shorted _after_ the flush, right into the support bounce.
2.  **Ignored the Underlying:** BTC had already bounced +10% off the $60k lows when we entered the proxy short.
3.  **News Lag:** Over-indexed on bearish headlines (lagging) vs. live price action (leading).
    **New Rule:**
    > **"The Proxy Rule":** Never short a crypto-proxy (MSTR/COIN) if the underlying asset (BTC) is currently up >5% from its intraday low (V-Shape Reversal). Wait for the underlying to break support first.
